# House of Teeth

is a 2D Godot game about the dinosaur Orpheus, who suddenly gets summoned
in a twisted house full of teeth hungry monsters (aka they want *your* teeth).
The higher being has requested to you to either sacrifice yourself and thus
your teeth, or somehow find enough teeth to offer to them. Only then
can you be freed from this nightmare..

It is also a shame that the haunted house doesn't have any healing supplies,
so you should probably take your time :D Move around with <kbd>WASD</kbd>/<kbd>↑←↓→</kbd>,
interact with <kbd>E</kbd>, use your suspicious pills with <kbd>P</kbd>, & and pause the game with <kbd>esc</kbd>/<kbd>0</kbd>.
